  <h5>How it worked</h5>

  <p>wakemydyno.com provided a very simple mechanism preventing your dyno from falling asleep: we pinged your
    site periodically!<br/>
    <strong>No registration</strong> was needed, however we asked you to create a <span>wakemydyno.txt</span> file
    under the root url of your site. Our crawler was hitting this file, keeping the dyno <strong>active</strong>.<br/>
    <br/>
    When <strong>you decided</strong> to stop being pinged, you just deleted <span>wakemydyno.txt</span> file and after a
    couple of days we droped your site from our pinging list. Was that <strong>simple!</strong></p>

  <h5>About</h5>

  <p>We all know how awesome <strong>Heroku</strong> is. Simplicity in creating environments for your rails, java,
    python or php application is just unbelievable.<br/>
    Create, deploy, BOOM! Your new app is ready, up and running! But if your site is powered by
    <strong>only 1 dyno</strong>, you will quickly <strong>notice</strong> that after a few hours of app's
    inactivity,
    it's first launch <strong>takes ages and ages</strong>... It is because your dyno was sleeping and now it has to
    be awakened.</p>

  <h5>Dynopoker gem</h5>

  <p>Dynopoker is a <strong>gem</strong> which prevents your Heroku dyno from falling asleep. The main idea is to launch a separate
    thread that will <strong>ping</strong> your site every hour, just like this site does. Please visit gem's github page and read the readme for more info:<br/>
    <a href="https://github.com/kubenstein/dynopoker">https://github.com/kubenstein/dynopoker</a><br/><br/>
    Maybe you have an idea how to modify dynopoker to fit to current Heroku situation. Please feel free to submit PR!
